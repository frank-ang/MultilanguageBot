# Multilanguage Chatbot

The Multilanguage Lex Bot example demonstrates a pattern to enable AWS customers to configure multilanguage conversational bot experiences across all 21 languages, overcoming the current US English monolingual limitationof Amazon Lex. 

The solution deploys a tranlation layer in front of the example Order Flowers Amazon Lex bot. This simple pattern provides a way for Amazon Lex bots to converse in all 21 languages supported by Amazon Translate. 

## Design

![Multilanguage Chatbot architecture](doc/architecture.jpeg) 

The environment is defined in a SAM template: [MultilanguageBot.yaml](). 

### User Experience

A sample [BotUI](https://botui.org/) user interface is provided. The following illustrates the bot contextually switching between 2 different languages in response to user input. In this example, the front-end switches between Chinese (Simplified) and Bahasa Indonesia, mediating with the Lex back-end which remains limited to US English. To users, the bot appears multilingual.

### CORS

The CORS ("Cross-origin resource sharing") browser security restriction arises from the fact that the S3 website endpoint and API Gateway endpoint have different DNS domain names.

To get around this, and to avoid fiddling with configuring CORS on API Gateway and Lambda, the approach used in this solution utilizes a common CloudFront distribution in front of both the S3 website and the API Gateway endpoint. 

## Installation

#### 1. Create a Lex Bot: 
 * Create the default "OrderFlowers" example using a blueprint. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/gs-bp-create-bot.html]()

### 2. Cognito Stack
Identity systems are shared across apps, so an existing Cognito setup can be used, or optionally, created using a new stack.

Steps:

* create Cognito stack [cognito/cognito-cfn.yaml]()
* create Cognito user [cognito/README.md]()

### 3. Multilanguage Function Stack

Launch the CloudFormation/SAM template: [MultilanguageBot.yaml](). 

This creates a BotTranslator Lambda function and API Gateway endpoint. IAM permissions are setup to permit calls to Comprehend, Translate, and Lex. 

### 4. Web stack

This is the S3 website hosting the botui.js web client, with AuthN via Cognito. Upload of new S3 content performed by CodePipeline + CodeBuild.

Access the webpage from CloudFront.

TODO: add more details and create the child CFN stacks.

## API Testing

### Example request
```
{
  "intent": LOCALIZED_MULTILANGUAGE_TEXT,
  "userid": USER_ID
}
```

### Example response

```
{
  "local_language": "zh",
  "en_response": "What type of flowers would you like to order?",
  "en_message": "I want to order flowers",
  "local_message": "我想订花",
  "local_response": "您想订购哪种类型的花?"
}
```

### Example confirmation of order :

```
{
  "confirmation": {
    "slots": {
      "PickupDate": "2018-10-26",
      "PickupTime": "09:00",
      "FlowerType": "Rose"
    },
    "dialogState": "ReadyForFulfillment",
    "intentName": "OrderFlowers",
    "ResponseMetadata": {
      "RetryAttempts": 0,
      "HTTPStatusCode": 200,
      "RequestId": "6edd92d4-d76a-11e8-bd4d-5f59a84f1d81",
      "HTTPHeaders": {
        "date": "Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:54:36 GMT",
        "x-amzn-requestid": "6edd92d4-d76a-11e8-bd4d-5f59a84f1d81",
        "content-length": "243",
        "content-type": "application/json",
        "connection": "keep-alive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
